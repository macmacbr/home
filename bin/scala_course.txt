<h1>Who should attend?</h1>

<p>
Part I of this workshop, <em>Applied Fundamentals</em> is designed to help experienced programmers 
learn Scala. It is not a beginning course in programming, but it doesn&#39;t assume any background
in <em>functional</em> programming. So long as you are familiar with at least one of the (more or less) mainstream
object-oriented languages (such as Java, C#, C++, Ruby, Python, or Smalltalk), this course is for you.
Prior experience with Java or C# is a plus, but not a pre-requisite.
</p>

<p>
Part II of this workshop, <em>Advanced Concepts</em> is designed to help people who have some experience with Scala
become more proficient in its use. An understanding of
Scala fundamentals, either from prior experience programming in Scala or by taking Part I of this course, is a pre-requisite.
</p>

<h1>What people are saying</h1>

<p>
Here&#39;s what students who attended previous Stairway to Scala training courses have to say about the experience:
</p>

<p>
"Stairway to Scala is an excellent way to kick-start your Scala skills. It provides a 
comprehensive, high-level overview of the language, as well as a set of exercises that 
are informative and just challenging enough to keep you entertained. Bill and Dick do a 
great job presenting difficult concepts in an easy-to-understand way. You will not be 
disappointed." Alex Furman, Founder, Locus Development  
</p>
 
<p>
"The Stairway to Scala Workshop was extremely valuable in cementing the 
fundamentals of Scala. By having leading Scala practitioners explain the functional-OO 
paradigm, the reasons behind the language&#39;s design decisions, and Scala best practices, 
my ability to learn Scala from other sources has greatly improved." Carter Roughton  
</p>
 
<p>
"The Stairway to Scala course was great fun other than being very useful and 
enlightening in the most difficult parts of Scala. Advanced, but I would also recommend 
it for students that not only do not know Scala, but that also do not know about 
functional/dynamic languages either." Massimo, Java Developer 
</p>
 
<p>
"The Stairway to Scala workshop was terrific and a great way to start learning about 
Scala. It opens up a new functional way of thinking for an imperative Java guy. Bill and 
Dick were very helpful in answering questions." Dinesh Narayanan 
</p>
 
<!--
<p>
"It&#39;s great to learn a powerful, complex, rich language from people who really grasp the 
very powerful and exotic features of the language DEEPLY." Carl Watts  
</p>
-->
 
<p>
The Stairway to Scala Workshop was comprehensive and technically complete. My goal 
was to walk away with a working knowledge of Scala, and I was not disappointed." Jim 
Bedenbaugh, President & CEO PLT Software  
</p>
 
<p>
"If you were to pick a language to learn, pick Scala and attend Bill and Dick&#39;s Stairway 
to Scala course. The course content is well orchestrated, interactive with plenty of 
hands-on lab sessions and well thought out by knowledgeable instructors at the 
forefront of Scala development." Chetan Conikee, Intuit, Inc. 
</p>
 
<p>
"Phenomenal class taught by an entertaining duo of Scala mavens. Their enthusiasm for 
the language and teaching was infectious." Corey Klaasmeyer 
</p>
 
<!--
<p>
"This course gave me a high level of understanding that will greatly improve the quality 
of my work. I expect that this week&#39;s course will save many weeks of work over the long 
term." Keith Bennett, FGM, Inc.
</p>

<p>
"It was wonderful to have access to two people who are so knowledgeble and so very willing to engage." Anonymous
</p>

<p>
"The best use of money for training I have seen! An amazing three days! Great interplay
between Bill and Dick&#8212;one presenting the information (with slides) the other
demoing Scala in real time, trying different things in a Scala shell projected above
the slides. The workshop was paced very well and covered the PinS book separated by related
exercises. The hands-on tools just worked (IntelliJ, Maven). The way ScalaTest was customized to stop
 at the first error was awesome in the exercises!" Darlene Wallach
</p>

<p>
"I came to the workshop hoping to be propelled forward in Scala. I was not disappointed.
I had already bought into the fact that Scala is an extremely powerful language. But,
honestly, I had no idea how powerful it really is until now. I was blown away time and time
again. Bill and Dick are excellent instructors who really know their craft. I&#39;m now ready
to surf the impending wave!" Bruce Ferguson, President, Epoch 6 Trading Solutions
</p>

<p>
"The workshop was excellent. The instructors are obviously very technically knowledgeable, but they
are also enthusiastic and capable teachers. They cover a lot of material, but do it at the right
zoom-level so that it sinks in even for a Scala novice. The exercises are perfectly sized
and tailored to learning just language features and not general programming. I would recommend
this class without reservation. I learned a lot and had fun doing it." Mehul Patel, Head Developer, NextEra Energy
</p>

<p>
"I had been searching for Scala classes, but getting a chance to learn about the language from an author of 
<em>Programming in Scala</em> was great. It gave me a very good introduction. Thanks a lot to Bill and Dick
to make this informative and fun." Anonymous
</p>

<p>
"Liked it very much! Very practical and covers a lot. Espcially loved all the exercises&#8212;very nicely done! Ability
to ask Martin Odersky was a very nice touch. Overall&#8212excellent!" Eugene Ryzhikov, Lead Developer
</p>

<p>
"This is a great experience! Best workshop I ever attended." Anonymous
</p>

<p>
"This seminar was extremely informative and interesting. The instructors are clearly very knowledgeable and approachable. The
class was a good mixture of presentations and practical exercises, which helped solidify the material." Patrick Kaeding
</p>

<p>
"After taking this workshop, I fell well-prepared to venture into my own Scala projects, tackle Scala fundamentals, and
explain to my collegues some of what makes Scala awesome." Anonymous
</p>

<p>
"Great language, knowledgeable and amiable instructors, good balance between presentations and exercises,
great breadth and surprising depth: what&#39;s not to like?" Anonymous
</p>

<p>
"This class was very challenging and thorough. The value of the course was greatly enhanced by the exercises, because they
were done as test suites. Bill and Dick presented with a sense of expertise, humor, and joy." Anonymous
</p>

<p>
"I learned all I would need to start developing in Scala here." Anonymous
</p>

<p>
"The workshop was great. Bill and Dick keep a very relaxed environment facilitating an easy and fun transfer of knowledge." Ben Barefield, SRT Solutions
</p>

<p>
"If learning Scala from a book or the web is exercising to a workout DVD, then Artima&#39;s Stairway to Scala is spring training
with a pro football team." Tim Taylor
</p>

<p>
"It was an excellently put together workshop. I&#39;m usually skeptical of abstraction more than what Java and its
frameworks provide, but this material was presented very convincingly and I can clearly see how this can help me be more
productive, spend more time/resources writing the code that actually matters." Sandeep Shrestha, Software Development Lead, Monsanto
</p>

<p>
"The five-day workshop gave my entire group the practical theory and hands-on training to dive right into beginning and
advance Scala projects. Bill and Dick customized the class to our needs before and even during the week." Ryan Richt, Monsanto Genome Integration Lead
</p>

<p>
"Stairway to Scala is a comprehensive and interactive experience. I highly recommend the full five-day course." Dianne Marsh, Cofounder, SRT Solutions
</p>

<p>
"Bill and Dick are very entertaining teachers and they really know the subject." Bruce Eckel
</p>


<p>
"Dick and Bill really know their stuff. They have obvious passion for Scala and for passing on their knowledge." Andrew Boudreau
